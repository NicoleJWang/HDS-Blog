        "\n",
        "Our hospital has been very proactive in terms of analysing data of its electronic medical record (EMR). By analysing the data, they have made very interesing discoveries:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. They identified that readmitted patients are not only those who were sicker in the first admission, but those who had less support at home after discharge or those patients that did not have a medical follow-up after discharge.\n",
        "2. Readmitted patients experienced high levels of emotional stress.\n",
        "3. Readmitted patients were at much higher risk of acquiring new infections while at hospital.\n",
        "4. Readmissions are highly costly. Patients that were readmitted for the reasons cited above tended to be sicker than they were when they were first admitted and their length of stay was significantly longer than their first admission.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our hospital has trialed a \"specialised unit\" that coordinates the patient's discharge. A team of nurses and OTs visit the patient's home after discharge. The frequency of the visits depends upon an assessment made before discharge, but the average number of visits is 5 across the board. Amongst other things, they make sure that the wounds are healing properly, medication is taken, that there is coordination with a GP in place and basic daily activities can be done, such as moving around their home, toilet, cooking, ...\n",
        "In addition, the specialised unit regularly contacts the patients via telephone to check that everything is going well. The patients can also contact the specialised unit if they need any help. \n",
        "\n",
        "This pilot has drastically reduced the number of readmissions. \n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, the cost of operating the specialised unit was much cheaper than the cost of readmissions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of budget:\n",
        "1. A day in hospital costs 5,000 dollars per day on average; readmitted patients tend to stay an average of 4 days.\n",
        "2. A home visit of the specialised unit costs 400 dollars; the average number of visits is 5. \n",
        "3. No targeted patients: 0 dollars\n",
        "\n",
        "Our hospital is now ready to roll out and implement the specialised unit service to all patients at risk for readmission. \n",
        "The problem is that a priori, they do not know which patients are at risk of readmission. Thus, they do not know the patients they should be targeting.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "<b><font color=green>Goal/Research Question: </font>\n",
        "1. The hospital needs a machine learning algorithm to predict which patients should participate in this intervention. The prediction will be done just before discharge. They are hiring you to build this algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. You will need to explain to the hospital managers the performance of your algoritm, so they can make an informed decision whether to use your algorithm or not."

        "1. We are going to deliver one predictive model to predict readmission to hospital within 30 days of discharge. \n",
        "\n",
        "2. Check and study the data provided. Read the data dictionary carefully and check again the plots and graphs created in the exercises corresponding to weeks 1, 2 and 3. \n",

        "\n",
        "5. The hospital wants the model to capture as many \"readmissions\" as posible (true positives) even at the expense of <font color='green'><b> moderately</b> </font> increasing the number of false positives <font color='green'><b>  within reason</b></font> (that is, patients that are not at risk of readmission that are classified as readmission). \n",
        "\n",
        "6. Nevertheless, we must take into account that the hospital does not have unlimited resources, so they cannot considered a high number of patients at risk of readmission because the cost of the \"specialised unit\" would be very high.  \n",
        "\n",
        "7. You will design several machine learning algorithms, choose one, and give a rationale explaining why you choose that algorithm. \n",

        "9. <b> Very Important: Justify your decisions and why they were made in the space provided.</b>   Write <b>one or two sentences</b> for each section before each block of Python code with the description of what the blocks do; explanations must be clear; no “sanity checks” (although these checks are encouraged during the construction of the algorithms); \n",
